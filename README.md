# Analytical-vidiya-project

## Overview
contains a step-by-step data analysis pipeline focusing on predictive modeling. It is structured to demonstrate various stages of data processing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries are used in this notebook:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model training and evaluation.
- Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
- XGBoost: For implementing gradient boosting algorithms.

## Contents of the Notebook
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- The dataset is loaded using pandas and involves cleaning and preparing the data for modeling. Handling of missing values, data normalization, and basic feature engineering are part of this step.
2. Feature Selection
- Several strategies for feature selection are applied, including statistical analysis, correlation matrices, and feature importance extraction.
3. Model Training
- A variety of machine learning models are implemented, including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluation of model performance is done using metrics such as:
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1 Score
- Confusion matrices and ROC-AUC curves are plotted to visually assess the model's performance.
